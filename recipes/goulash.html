    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Goulash is a stew made of beef or other meat and vegetables, mostly 
        tomatoes and bell peppers, and generously seasoned with paprika 
        powder. The dish originated in Hungary from where it traveled to 
        other Central European countries and beyond. As a result, there 
        are countless goulash variations, such as pork goulash, and even 
        goulash made with chicken or turkey. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons lard</li>
        <li>2 large onions, finely sliced</li>
        <li>2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Hungarian paprika</li>
        <li>1 cup water, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt lard in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir 
            onions in hot lard until soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir beef and paprika into onions. Reduce heat to low and simmer 
            for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Add 1 cup water and simmer, 
            adding more water if moisture gets too low, until meat falls 
            apart and onion sauce is thick, about 1 hour more. Season with 
            salt and pepper to taste. </li>
    </ol>
